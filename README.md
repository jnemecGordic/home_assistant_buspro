# HDL Buspro

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

The HDL Buspro integration allows you to control your HDL Buspro system from Home Assistant.

## Installation
Under HACS -> Integrations, add custom repository "https://github.com/MyMight/home_assistant_buspro/" with Category "Integration". Select the integration named "HDL Buspro" and download it.

Restart Home Assistant.

Go to Settings > Integrations and Add Integration "HDL Buspro". Type in IP address and port number of the gateway.

## Configuration

#### Light platform
   
To use your Buspro light in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file: 

```yaml
light:
  - platform: buspro
    running_time: 3
    devices:
      "1.89.1":
        name: Living Room Light
        running_time: 5
      "1.89.2":
        name: Front Door Light
        dimmable: False
```
+ **running_time** _(int) (Optional)_: Default running time in seconds for all devices. Running time is 0 seconds if not set.
+ **devices** _(Required)_: A list of devices to set up
  + **X.X.X** _(Required)_: The address of the device on the format `<subnet ID>.<device ID>.<channel number>`
    + **name** _(string) (Required)_: The name of the device
    + **running_time** _(int) (Optional)_: The running time in seconds for the device. If omitted, the default running time for all devices is used.
    + **dimmable** _(boolean) (Optional)_: Is the device dimmable? Default is True. 
    + **scan_interval** _(int) (Optional)_: Polling interval in seconds. Default is 0 (updates handled by system's background polling). Set a specific interval only for entities where you need guaranteed update frequency, as frequent polling of many entities may impact system performance.

#### Switch platform

To use your Buspro switch in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file: 

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: buspro
    devices:
      "1.89.1":
        name: Living Room Switch
      "1.89.2":
        name: Front Door Switch
```

It is also possible to use the switch to control buttons on control panels (switches) on the wall.
For this, you need to specify the `device` parameter as `panel`.

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: buspro
    devices:
      "1.79.1":
        name: Living Room Panel Button 1
        device: panel

The ECO preset mode uses HDL Timer mode where temperature is automatically switched between day and night settings according to schedule configured in HDL system. Manual temperature control is disabled in ECO mode.

#### Button platform

To use HDL Buspro buttons in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
button:
  - platform: buspro
    devices:
      "200.2.1.on":     # subnet.device.button.state
        name: "Button 1 ON"
      "200.2.1.off":
        name: "Button 1 OFF"
      "200.2.2.on":

    + **subnet ID** - subnet number (1-255)
    + **device ID** - device number (1-255)
    + **button number** - button number (1-255)
    + **state** - `on` or `off` (determines the value sent when pressed)
    + **name** _(string) (Required)_: The name of the button

When pressed, the button sends panel control command with the configured state value to the specified device address.

#### Cover platform

To use your Buspro covers in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml

        name: Bedroom Blinds
        invert: true  # Invert open/close behavior
```

The cover platform supports the following features:
- Opening and closing operations
- Stop command to halt movement
- Tilt functionality using precise step control
  - Small upward step (tilt up)
  - Small downward step (tilt down)

Configuration parameters:
+ **devices** _(Required)_: A list of devices to set up
  + **address** _(string) (Required)_: The address of the device in format `<subnet ID>.<device ID>.<channel>` where:
    + **subnet ID** - subnet number (1-255)

The cover platform supports:
- Full open/close control
- Stop function
- Small step movement mapped as tilt control

#### Security Module

To use your HDL Buspro security module in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
alarm_control_panel:
  - platform: buspro
    devices:
      - address: "1.89.1"  # subnet.device.area
        name: "Home Security"
        scan_interval: 60        
      - address: "1.89.2"
        name: "Office Security"        
```

The security module supports the following features:
- Disarming the alarm system
- Arming in multiple modes (home, away, night, vacation, etc.)

Configuration parameters:
+ **devices** _(Required)_: A list of devices to set up
  + **address** _(string) (Required)_: The address of the device in format `<subnet ID>.<device ID>.<area>`  
    + **device ID** - device number (1-255)
    + **area** - area ID (1-8)
    + **name** _(string) (Required)_: The name of the security module area
    + **scan_interval** _(int) (Optional)_: Polling interval in seconds. Default is 0 (updates handled by system's background polling). Set a specific interval only for entities where you need guaranteed update frequency, as frequent polling of many entities may impact system performance.


**Important**: You must configure your HDL security module to allow access from the Home Assistant integration device address (254.253). This permission should be set in HDL Buspro Setup Tool.

The alarm control panel supports the following states, mapped to HDL Buspro security module states:

| Home Assistant State | HDL Buspro State     |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| DISARMED             | Disarm               |
| ARMED_HOME           | Day Arm              |
| ARMED_NIGHT          | Night Arm            |
| ARMED_AWAY           | Away Arm             |
| ARMED_VACATION       | Vacation Arm         |
| ARMED_CUSTOM_BYPASS  | Night with Guest Arm |

The security module offers comprehensive alarm management capabilities that integrate directly with the HDL Buspro security subsystem.
